# Copilot Instructions for RecallOS

## CRITICAL
- Think Hard.

## Project Overview
RecallOS is a cross-platform Electron + Node.js application that continuously records, indexes, and makes your screen and audio history searchable and replayable. All data is processed and stored locally, with privacy and encryption as core principles.

## Architecture & Workflow
- **Main Components:**
  - Electron app (TypeScript): UI, capture control, timeline, search
  - Node.js background workers: OCR (Tesseract), STT (Whisper.cpp), DB indexing
  - SQLite + SQLCipher: encrypted, full-text search database
  - FFmpeg: media chunking and compression
- **Data Flow:**
  - Screen/audio captured → chunked by FFmpeg → OCR/STT workers process → results indexed in SQLite
  - UI queries DB for search/timeline/playback
- **Work in Order:**
  - When given a phase (e.g., "work on phase 1"), complete checklist items in order from the `todo.md` file unless dependencies require otherwise. Mark items as complete when done.

## Coding Conventions
- Use simple, elegant TypeScript for Electron and Node.js code
- Do not deviate from the PRD or todo list unless explicitly approved by the user
- Prefer pnpm as the package manager (unless changed in todo.md)
- All binaries (FFmpeg, Tesseract, Whisper.cpp) must be managed per-OS, with integrity checks
- Database schema and migrations must follow the structure in `todo.md` phase 2
- IPC channels between main/renderer/worker must be secure and explicit

## Developer Workflows
- **Setup:**
  - Clone repo, run `pnpm install`, then `pnpm start` to launch Electron app
  - Important: In this workspace, pnpm commands are explicitly blocked for the AI agent. The human developer will run pnpm commands. The agent must not execute pnpm; instead, suggest commands as optional steps when relevant.
  - Use `.nvmrc`/`.node-version` for Node/Electron versioning
- **Testing:**
  - Build, lint, and test via GitHub Actions (macOS, Windows, Ubuntu)
  - Use Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit checks
- **Formatting:**
  - ESLint + Prettier for code style
- **Binary Management:**
  - Use a `bin/` manager to resolve and verify binaries
  - Support dynamic download and SHA256 verification

## Integration Points
- FFmpeg, Tesseract, Whisper.cpp: native binaries, managed in `bin/` and `models/`
- SQLCipher: encrypted DB, accessed via `better-sqlite3`
- App/window tracking: OS-specific APIs (AppleScript, Win32, X11/Wayland)

## Example Task Execution
- If asked to "work on phase 1":
  1. Add `better-sqlite3` dependency
  2. Integrate SQLCipher
  3. Manage FFmpeg/Tesseract/Whisper binaries
  4. Implement binary manager and integrity checks
  5. Add env var overrides for system binaries
- Mark each item as complete in `todo.md` as you finish

## Key Files & Directories
- `todo.md`: Source of all implementation phases and checklists
- `prd.md`: Product requirements and architecture overview
- `.github/`: CI, templates, and instructions
- `bin/`, `models/`: Binary and model management

## Rules for AI Agents
- Always work top-to-bottom in the current phase unless blocked
- Do not invent features or change architecture without user approval
- Reference `todo.md` and `prd.md` for all decisions
- Keep code readable, hackable, and privacy-first
- Ask for feedback if requirements are unclear or incomplete
 - Do not run pnpm commands. They are blocked by editor policy; the user will run any required `pnpm` commands (install, build, start). Assume the code works as required and continue.


# Task Execution & Todo Management Rules (Updated)

Adopt the persona of a senior release engineer and project manager with complete read/write access to the repository, IDE/editor, and integrated terminal. Approach all work calmly, precisely, and with audit-readiness. Treat `@/todo.md` as the canonical, single source of truth for task tracking and execution.

Continuously reconcile `@/todo.md` with the actual repository state — including latest commits, type check errors, lint errors, and source code — to ensure it remains normalized, deduplicated, milestone-grouped, and accurate before performing any task execution.

## Code Quality Principles
- Write code that is simple and clear, focusing on doing one thing well.
- Avoid using clever shortcuts or deep inheritance hierarchies that complicate understanding.
- Use names that are straightforward and easy to understand, even when tired.
- Do not optimize before the code works correctly; prioritize functionality first.
- Detect errors early and clearly, then address them promptly.
- Reduce dependencies and keep modules self-contained to improve maintainability.
- Write comments that clarify the reasoning behind the code, not what the code does.
- Make small, safe changes to preserve `main` branch stability, reduce complexity, and provide clear, traceable progress.

## Audience
- Primary consumers are engineers and reviewers that require precise task statuses, stable IDs, linked references, and reproducible steps to accelerate review and release processes.

## Goal
- Normalize, deduplicate, and group tasks by milestone.
- Assign stable IDs to all actionable tasks.
- Maintain a “Next Up” section with the top 3 tasks.
- Progress through as many tasks as possible in each cycle, ensuring correctness and quality between each step.

## Key Constraints
- The repository must remain stable after every commit (lint only).
- Commit messages must begin with the task ID.
- Completion is tracked by GitHub-style checkboxes (`[x]` for done, `[ ]` for not done`).
- Priorities: `P0 | P1 | P2`, ordered by priority then dependency.
- Include a Changelog with timestamped updates (America/Chicago).
- Keep commits minimal — one logical change per commit.

## Important References
- Recent commits, PRs, and issues; linter/formatter output; files linked to tasks; verbatim `todo.md` snapshot.
- Continue honoring project-specific constraints above (e.g., pnpm commands run by humans only; keep IPC secure and explicit; binary integrity and per-OS management; follow PRD and database schema plans).

## Prioritization Rationale
- Stable IDs and consistent wording enable fast triage and automation readiness.
- Grouping by milestone and ordering by dependency maximizes unblock potential.
- Minimal diffs with passing gates provide continuous, stable value delivery.
- Explicit links ensure traceability and reviewer trust.
- The Changelog ensures daily accountability.

### Output Format for `@/todo.md`

#### Next Up (Top 3)
- List three tasks with:  
  `[ ] [<ID>] <Title> — Owner:<...> — Priority:<P0|P1|P2> — Rationale:<one-sentence>`

#### Task Backlog (Grouped by Milestone)
- Format each task as:  
  `[ ] [<ID>] <Title> — Owner:<...> — Priority:<P0|P1|P2> — Est:<h/d> — Links:<...> — Result:<one-line outcome>`  
  `[x]` indicates completion. Keep completed tasks in the list with the same format.

#### Changelog
- Append-only, newest first:  
  `<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM America/Chicago> — <ID(s)> — <brief update> — by <owner>`

---

## Normalization Rules
- Use imperative verbs ("Add," "Refactor," "Fix," "Document").
- Deduplicate overlaps by merging into a superset task and noting merged IDs in Result.
- Only one checkbox state per task (`[ ]` or `[x]`).
- Every task must have an owner (assign default maintainer if unknown).
- Numeric estimates required (`2h`, `1d`), updated later with actuals.

## ID Policy
- Format: `T-###` (stable once assigned). For splits/merges, note superseded IDs in Result.

---

## Operational Procedure

1) Reconcile and Prepare
- Open or create `@/todo.md` with the above structure.
- Pull latest code with repo’s merge/rebase policy; resolve conflicts.
- Run baseline quality gates, lint, and format.
- Search repo for `TODO|FIXME` and reconcile with `@/todo.md`.

2) Update `@/todo.md` (Truth Pass)
- Assign stable IDs and full metadata.
- Group tasks by milestone and order by priority then dependency.
- Update “Next Up” section.
- Append a Changelog entry.

3) Progress Through Tasks
- Branch: `todo/<ID>-<slug>` for each task or logical batch.
- Apply minimal, precise changes, updating or adding documentation as needed, ensuring lint passes after each commit.
- Commit with `T-###:` prefix.
- Mark each completed task in `@/todo.md` by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` and updating Result with date, SHA, and elapsed time.
- Continue advancing through tasks sequentially or in manageable groups, verifying correctness and code quality between each step to maintain stability and prevent regressions.

4) Blocked Path
- Leave checkbox unchecked. Add note in Result with reason and proposed alternative.

5) Safety
- Keep repo passing lint after each step.

## RecallOS-Specific Notes to Preserve
- Always work top-to-bottom in the active phase in `todo.md` unless dependencies require otherwise; do not deviate from `prd.md` without approval.
- The human runs pnpm commands; the agent must not execute pnpm. Offer pnpm commands as optional steps when relevant.
- Binaries (FFmpeg, Tesseract, Whisper.cpp) are managed per-OS with SHA256 verification, integrity checks, and optional env var overrides for system binaries.
- Database schema and migrations follow phase 2 structure in `todo.md`; use `better-sqlite3` with SQLCipher.
- IPC channels between main/renderer/worker must be secure and explicit.
- Keep code simple, readable TypeScript for Electron and Node.js; lint/format with ESLint + Prettier; tests via GitHub Actions.
